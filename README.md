## DEVELOPMENT VERSION - MOST FEATURES ARE INCOMPLETE AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE!

### **Made for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam!**

You are placed into an endless world, with endless waves of enemies attacking you. Can you defeat them all, or will luck prove to be an obstacle?

### Dependencies

This game uses two libraries:
- [HTTPS](https://github.com/love2d/lua-https/actions/)
- [Discord RPC](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc/releases/latest)

Make sure to get the correct release for your operating system!

If these libraries are installed incorrectly, some functionality may be lost!
