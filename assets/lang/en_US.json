        "tutorial.intro1": "Hello! Welcome to The Slash of the Dice!",
        "tutorial.intro2": "In this game, you must defeat endless waves of enemies while also enduring the test of luck!",
        "tutorial.intro3": "But before we get into all the little gimmicks of this game, you should learn how to actually play!",
        "tutorial.intro4.desktop": "If you need to take a break, you can pause the game by pressing the Escape key.",
        "tutorial.intro4.mobile": "If you need to take a break, you can pause the game by pressing the Pause button at the top right.",
        "tutorial.intro5": "You can exit the tutorial at any time by pressing \"Return to Title\" on the pause menu.",
        "tutorial.movement.desktop": "To move, use the W, A, S, and D keys. Try it out!",
        "tutorial.movement.mobile": "To move, use the thumbstick at the bottom left. Try it out!",
        "tutorial.slash1": "Great job!",
        "tutorial.slash2": "In this game, you have a slash ability. This ability lunges you forward and harms anything in its path!",
        "tutorial.slash3.desktop": "To use this ability, left click in the direction you want to slash!",
        "tutorial.slash3.mobile": "To use this ability, tap the Slash button at the bottom right while moving in the direction you want to slash!",
        "tutorial.dice1": "Good! Now, you'll learn about the mechanics of possibly the most common board game piece yet: dice.",
        "tutorial.dice2": "At the bottom right corner of your screen, you'll see a single die appear.",
        "tutorial.dice3": "These dice will determine how much your stats change by every time you kill an enemy!",
        "tutorial.dice4": "Oh, right! I almost forgot about the enemies. How could I forget those? They're a vital part of the game!",
        "tutorial.dice5": "Let's check them out, shall we?",
        "tutorial.enemies1": "Nearby, you'll see the enemy of the game! They would normally hurt you, but for the sake of the tutorial, I have frozen this one in place so it won't attack.",
        "tutorial.enemies2": "The more of these you kill, the higher your score goes! You can see your current score at the bottom left.",
        "tutorial.enemies3": "Your score right now is 0. Let's change that! Slash through the enemy until you defeat it.",
        "tutorial.enemies4": "Good! You may have noticed that you received a die when you killed the enemy.",
        "tutorial.enemies5": "It may have been good, or it may have been bad. It all comes down to luck!",
        "tutorial.end1": "The game spawns enemies, just like the one you just defeated, every few seconds. As the game progresses, these enemies get stronger until you eventually cannot defeat them anymore.",
        "tutorial.end2": "For the sake of the tutorial, the enemies' strength will not increase, and their attacks have been weakened.",
        "tutorial.end3": "The timer at the top shows how much time until the next enemy spawns. Once it reaches zero, another enemy spawns.",
        "tutorial.end4": "To complete the tutorial, defeat 5 more enemies!",
        "tutorial.complete": "Good job!\nYou have completed the tutorial. Head back to the title to start playing!",
